# GD Comment Bot

A Geometry Dash bot that automatically comments on recent tab levels, created with care by cnsl.

## Introduction
If you've encountered the "girl" bots on Geometry Dash that direct you to https://discord.gg/robtopgames, then you might be familiar with me. This is a simplified public version of that bot, designed to handle one account at a time without the need for a proxy.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Node.js**: Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and install Node.js.
2. **Clone/Download**: Clone or download the project and extract the files.
3. **Configuration**: Make sure to set up your Geometry Dash account in the `config.yml` file.

## First Time Setup
- Run `setup.bat` or execute `npm install` in the terminal within the project directory.

## Running the Bot
- Launch the bot by executing `start.bat`.

## Need Assistance?
